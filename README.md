# Crane Cloud CMS Backend

Automated application deployment, management, and scaling.

Crane Cloud is an open source multi-cloud software platform for cloud-native application deployment and management.

This is the backend for the [Crane Cloud CMS](https://cms.cranecloud.io) web application. It is used to power the CMS frontend and serve some resources via an API. These resources include: events, articles, and other content.

## Setup

- Simply make a copy of the `docker-compose.yml` file on your local machine and run it.
- After all the installation open `phpadmin` and import our CMS database.
- You can now login to the CMS using the Crane Cloud credentials and everything should be working.

**You can request for a copy of our CMS database and CC credentials from slack.**
